// 1.	Find the Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
// 2.	Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
// 3.	Rotate Array: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
// 4.	Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
// 5.	Merge Sorted Arrays: Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
// 6.	Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
// 7.	Product of Array Except Self: Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
// 8.	Majority Element: Given an array nums of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
// 9.	Container With Most Water: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai), n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
// 10.	Sort Colors: Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
